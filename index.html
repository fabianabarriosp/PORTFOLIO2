                        <p>I made different designs, one more journal-looking and another one with a magazine style. The magazine design felt more elegant and aligned with the professional tone I wanted for my portfolio. I chose a picture of myself from two different angles: one for the cover page (front view) and one for the end page (back view). The idea was to symbolize the journey and progression throughout the projects, where the front-facing image introduces me and my work, and the back-facing image marks the conclusion.</p>

It’s simple but professional, which helps showcase my work without distractions.

                        <p>I was told the idea of making my portfolio like a magazine and adding the animation to flip the pages was really cool, although navigation would be interesting to see what i would come up with. At first i was planning on creating an index page but soon realized it was not ideal as the user would have to scroll through all the pages and cannot easily access a specific section.</p>

                        <p>Creating my portfolio has been an important learning experience. I initially aimed for an interactive, magazine-style design with animations to showcase my creativity. However, after struggling for weeks, I reassessed my priorities and shifted to a minimalist black-and-white style, focusing on clarity and functionality. This decision taught me the value of adaptability and purpose over perfection. The portfolio also allowed me to reflect on my progress and understand how to present my work professionally, helping me realize the importance of organizing information and storytelling in my career. Moving forward, I plan to refine the design while keeping it clean and effective.</p>

                        <p>Although my design wasn't the final one we presented to the Blik representatives I still played a role in creating the final deliverables. Because the Blik ladies wanted a playful style for their brand I came up with the squiggly lines that represent an abstract path, because Blik is an improvisation theater group, the audience (and even the actors themselves) never know where they´re heading. The squiggly lines are undefined and do not cross but eventually connect when its needed, just like people.</p>

                        <p>"It’s not you, It’s our gear" is a slogan i came up with to emphasize that Monkshop takes responsibility for providing top-quality gear. I wanted to imply that if their climb isn’t going well, it’s the fault of their equipment and not their abilities. We presented our ideas to the clients and they mentioned it came off as dismissive rather than encouraging. So I changed the tone of the next iteraations.</p>

                        <p>The message changes to "Our expertise, Your climb," shifting focus from taking responsibility for the gear to a more collaborative relationship between Monkshop and the climber. I made "Your" bold to empower the climber and make it about them. I changed the monk logo to yellow as its associated with feelings of optimism, energy, and confidence and to create a more cohesive and relaxing feel when looking at the image.</p>

                        <p>Clients didn't enjoy the first designs so I used the same tagline but emphasizing “Your” in a colorful and playful way to simulate the colored rocks when practicing bouldering inside. Monk aims to have positive encouragement with its customers so the over-sized, colorful letters in "Your" immediately draw attention to the message that Monk’s products and expertise are focused on empowering the climber's personal journey (in bouldering and outside). Some people may not relate the letters with the holds, which come in different shapes, sizes, and colors to create routes with various difficulty levels and styles for climbers and that´s the reason I specifically chose this image for the background of the poster.</p>

                        <p>My interpretation of this tagline is that Monkshop is trying to encourage its customers to finally confront and overcome challenges that have been holding them back, specifically  to embrace the difficulties that come with bouldering but also in their personal lives, evoking emotions in the target audience so they feel closer to Monk. In particular, I created these posters to encourage everyone to start bouldering, as age is just a number, focus on the gear (provided by Monk) and to seek discomfort in trying new things instead of laying down. Bold big letters to make the tagline standout.<br>My focus was in creating positive feelings of encouragement, as opposed to my first iterations, to reflects the brand’s commitment to their growth and fosters trust and loyalty with Monk.</p>

Specifically to highlight that Monk provides high-quality gear suitable for climbers of all ages and abilities, provides right gear without the burden of carrying excess or ineffective equipment, and to motivate  climbers to choose MonkShop equipment that encourages them to get off the couch and climb.</p>

                        <p>With the layout exercise I learned the importance of taking your time into planning as each member of the group started cutting shapes with no sense of direction and ended up wasting time and materials. After I made a rough draft of the content I cut out the shapes and we were able to create the magazine. As for the Fiddle exercise, I feel this was a must-do exercise as it refreshed my memory after a long summer as it allowed me to re-gain certain knowledge like shortcuts to save time. I now  realize how helpful commenting on code is for easier editing later on. This specific task was very beneficial to my portfolio project as it really made me practice with grid layout.</p>

First, I was stuck on what to get him for his birthday because he has his own money and could generaly buy anything he wanted. Aditionally, I was feeling overwhelmed because my portfolio magazine hadnt worked out and figured I could use my Media Design knowledge for a real life scenario.  </p>

                        <p>In the first iteration, the bold, all-caps serif font and bright green background emphasizes the page and captures attention immediately. In the second, the Beau Rivage font gives an elegant touch, but I mainly chose it because it looks like my dads handwriting and I wanted to make it seem like he had written that (because its his recipe). I used a modern sans-serif for the actual "recipe" body text in both versions, to make sure that the instructions are easy to read and follow.</p>

This helped us recognize in a deeper level our strengths and weaknesses as a group to be able to work better together. At the beginning of our first project I created a team charter to set a general idea of the team members to help us exploit our strengths.<br>After identifying our own Belbin attributes, we shared them with each other and mostly everyone was in the same symphony.</p>

            <p>This LO emphasized the value of using professional design tools, and to choose wisely which tools use for what task, like affinity design or illustrator, as well as having an iterative approach to creating visual products. It taught me how essential it is to refine designs over time, testing and improving them based on feedback from others. Iterations have helped me develop more effective designs, sharpening my skills in both creativity and technical execution.</p>
