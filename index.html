                        <p>This project is to showcase the work I've done throughout the semester like my technical skills, such as web development, brand design and multimedia content creation. It's used to document the projects I've worked on like Branding theater Blik, Media Campaign for Monk, Project X and allows me to track my progress over time.</p>

                        <h5>Design Choices</h5>
                        <p>I started creating this idea I had envisioned on Figma. I made different designs, one more journal-looking and another one with a magazine style which I thought gave an elegant touch to the project. I used a picture showing me from the front angle (cover page) and the same one from a back angle (end page) to mark the front and back of the diary. I specifically chose the same picture with different angles to symbolize the journey and progression throughout the different projects, beginning with the front-face image that introduces me and my work and concluding with the back-face image.</p>

                        <p>I used tools like Affinity Design, Figma and Pinterest to create my portfolio. Pinterest to help me gather my ideas which I later envisioned in AD and created a prototype in Figma.</p>

                        <p>Creating a portfolio was essential for my learning. It helped me show my skills, reflect on my progress along the semester, and understand how to present my work in a professional, creative way. It taught me how to organize information in an effective way and a key step in understanding the importance of storytelling and visual presentation in my career.</p>

                        <p>I was told the idea of making my portfolio like a magazine and adding the animation to flip the pages was really cool, although navigation would be interesting to see what i would come up with. At first i was planning on creating an index page but soon realized it was not ideal as the user would have to scroll through all the pages and cannot easily access a specific section.</p>

                        <p>We were assigned to re-brand Theater Blik, four women aiming to expand their little improv group in Amersfoort into an association of actors and musicians. Our mission was to create a brand identity for the Blik group that fits their goals and personality. Additionally, provide useful tips on how to update different social media platforms to promote their work around The Netherlands.</p>

                        <p>I thought our designing for BLIK needed a little pop of color, and created squiggly lines that would add some playfulness. The lines are undefined and have no specific path but connect when its needed, just like the people that compose Blik.</p>

                        <p>Although my design wasn't the final one we presented to the Blik representatives I still played a role in creating the final deliverables. Because the Blik ladies wanted a playful style for their brand I came up with the squiggly lines that represent an abstract path, because Blik is an improvisation theater group, the audience (and even the actors themselves) never know where they´re heading. The squiggly lines are undefined and do not cross but eventually connect when its needed, just like people.</p>

                        <p>We had to create a media campaign for Monkshop and place them as leading experts in bouldering. Before creating visuals for our Campaign I created a research proposal to help us figure out how to approach the marketing of Monkshop.</p>

                        <p>"It’s not you, It’s our gear" is a slogan i came up with to emphasize that Monkshop takes responsibility for providing top-quality gear. I wanted to imply that if their climb isn’t going well, it’s the fault of their equipment and not their abilities. We presented our ideas to the clients and they mentioned it came off as dismissive rather than encouraging. So I changed the tone of the next iteraations.</p>

                        <p>The message changes to "Our expertise, Your climb," shifting focus from taking responsibility for the gear to a more collaborative relationship between Monkshop and the climber. I made "Your" bold to empower the climber and make it about them. I changed the monk logo to yellow as its associated with feelings of optimism, energy, and confidence and to create a more cohesive and relaxing feel when looking at the image.</p>

                        <p>Clients didn't enjoy the first designs so I used the same tagline but emphasizing “Your” in a colorful and playful way to simulate the colored rocks when practicing bouldering inside. Monk aims to have positive encouragement with its customers so the over-sized, colorful letters in "Your" immediately draw attention to the message that Monk’s products and expertise are focused on empowering the climber's personal journey (in bouldering and outside). Some people may not relate the letters with the holds, which come in different shapes, sizes, and colors to create routes with various difficulty levels and styles for climbers and that´s the reason I specifically chose this image for the background of the poster.</p>

                            <p>We presented again our ideas to the client and didn't approve any of them. We brainstormed possible concepts to focus our campaign on. The final 2 ideas that made the cut were “Whats your excuse” and “Be”, both encouraging.</p>

                            <p>My interpretation of this tagline is that Monkshop is trying to encourage its customers to finally confront and overcome challenges that have been holding them back, specifically  to embrace the difficulties that come with bouldering but also in their personal lives, evoking emotions in the target audience so they feel closer to Monk. In particular, I created these posters to encourage everyone to start bouldering, as age is just a number, focus on the gear (provided by Monk) and to seek discomfort in trying new things instead of laying down. Bold big letters to make the tagline standout.<br>My focus was in creating positive feelings of encouragement, as opposed to my first iterations, to reflects the brand’s commitment to their growth and fosters trust and loyalty with Monk.</p>

                        <p>Clients told me the first designs  are original designs, eye-catchy but they deviate from Monk and I should focus on promoting the actual shop because these specifically seem like their message is to target a broader audience.</p>

Specifically to highlight that Monk provides high-quality gear suitable for climbers of all ages and abilities, provides right gear without the burden of carrying excess or ineffective equipment, and to motivate  climbers to choose MonkShop equipment that encourages them to get off the couch and climb.</p>

After I made a rough draft of the content I cut out the shapes and we were able to create the magazine. As for the Fiddle exercise, I feel this was a must-do exercise as it refreshed my memory after a long summer as it allowed me to re-gain certain knowledge like shortcuts to save time. I now  realize how helpful commenting on code is for easier editing later on. This specific task was very beneficial to my portfolio project as it really made me practice with grid layout.</p>

                        <p>Creating my portfolio has been a journey of learning and adaptability. Initially, I was excited to build an interactive, magazine-style design with animations, showcasing my creativity and technical skills. However, after two weeks of being stuck, I reassessed my priorities. The main goal is to present my work clearly, so I drastically chnaged plans to a minimalistic black-and-white design that highlights my projects and ensures my teachers can assess my progress effectively. This decision wasn’t easy for me to make, but it taught me to focus on purpose over perfection. Moving forward, I plan to refine the design before the final deadline in January, refining ceratin aspects while keeping it clean and functional. This experience has been a valuable reminder that adaptability and prioritization are key to achieving success.</p>
